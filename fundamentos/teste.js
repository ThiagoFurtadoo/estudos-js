//Just a little test that i did in order to make sure that i didn't forget anything.

console.log("Buying tv:")

const price = 30
const taxes = 1.4
const pricewtaxes = price * taxes

console.log('Price = ' + price + ' Taxes = ' + taxes)

const productname = "Tv = "
const type = "House Product = "

console.log('Final price: ' + pricewtaxes)
